# Solving for Multipe Layers Simultaneously

Layer 1 Address endpoint authentication

Layer 2 analyzes session behavior

Layer 3 Monitors accound behavior for a channel

Layer 4 Monitor account behavior across multiple channels

Layer 5 Monitoring multiple account behaviors across multiple channels

# Rule-Based Fraud Detection

Transaction comes in » goes through a rule engine » approve / deny

# Rules Fall short for Fraud Detection

- Static set of Rules

  - Cannot do multi-level fraud Detection

- Human errors and bias with rulesets

- Difficult to manage

- _cannot scale_

# Solution requirements

- process billions of transations a day
- **Make decisions in milliseconds**
- Train with large amounts of data
